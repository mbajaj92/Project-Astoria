Parser -> IR/DT -> SSA (CSE(Anchor), CP(eliminate move)) -> Do arrays and procedures -> RA -> Lowering to machine code.

What about uninitialized variables?
We an either emit an error(More elegant), or assume that it is zero(but this works as well)
when we are trying to load, but the value is not present in ALAT; we will come to know that the value is un-initialized.

Globals v/s locals ?
We are allowed to reference Global variables in the procedures, so how to maintain

only in the very last step when we are translating to machine code, we link procedures and the main 

before calling the procedure, save the variables at a particular location, the procedure read it & update there; and then main reads it from there.
first get the procedure running, then try adding it later.

NOT IN ANCHOR - adda

Lets say we have a 2-D Array. 
a[4][2]; this means 4 rows, 2 cols
the load store chain will actually be used for arrays
use adda for arrays(this is for offset of memory addresses only)
USE THIS LATER, during machine translation, LDX takes 2 registers Ra, rb, rc 


procedures -> pass them on the stack

no check required for undeclared variables.


How to use frame pointers and stack pointers for procedures.
I add the parameters and move the SP ahead
then we do the call, then save the RA
save the old FP and then update the FP/SP
reserve space for my locals (IMP)
