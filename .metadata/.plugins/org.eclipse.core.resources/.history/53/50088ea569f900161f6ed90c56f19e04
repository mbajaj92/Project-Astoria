What about uninitialized variables?
We an either emit an error(More elegant), or assume that it is zero(but this works as well)
when we are trying to load, but the value is not present in ALAT; we will come to know that the value is un-initialized.

Globals v/s locals ?
We are allowed to reference Global variables in the procedures, so how to maintain

only in the very last step when we are translating to machine code, we link procedures and the main 

before calling the procedure, save the variables at a particular location, the procedure read it & update there; and then main reads it from there.
first get the procedure running, then try adding it later.
